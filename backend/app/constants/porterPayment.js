 * Payment vocabulary for the porter desk (local City Parcel + outstation

 * Deliberately its own file rather than an extension of `constants/payment.js`.
 * That one describes the marketplace order payment, which is keyed on an
 * Order and settles to a seller. A porter payment has no seller, no line
 * items, and three different reasons for existing — sharing an enum would
 * force every future change to either to be reasoned about twice.
 *
 * The status values themselves intentionally MATCH `PAYMENT_STATUS` so a
 * single Razorpay adapter can map a gateway state once and both ledgers can
 * read it. Only the transition table and the sources differ.
