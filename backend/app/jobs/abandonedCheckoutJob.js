/**
 * Clears out bookings whose payment sheet was opened and never completed.
 *
 * Both porter products insert their row before the customer pays, because
 * the gateway order has to hang off something. Listings already hide those
 * rows (see services/bookingCheckoutService.js), but hidden is not gone:
 * without this they accumulate in the collection forever, one per abandoned
 * tap of "Pay", slowing every query that has to skip past them.
 *
 * Runs rarely on purpose. The rows are invisible either way, so nothing is
 * waiting on this; the only cost of a slow sweep is a little dead weight in
 * the collection, and a fast one would repeatedly scan for work that comes
 * up hours apart.
