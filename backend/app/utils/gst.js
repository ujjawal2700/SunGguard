 * outstation should never see the two disagree by a paisa on the same fare.

 * `45.5 * 0.18` and a tax total that fails to reconcile with the sum of its
 * own CGST and SGST halves, which is exactly the kind of drift a tax auditor
 * finds first.
 *
 * Intra-state supply is assumed: the platform, the pickup and the drop are
 * all in one state for a local delivery, and the outstation leg is billed as
 * a service rendered where the parcel was collected. IGST is therefore always
 * zero here, but is carried through the shape so an inter-state variant can
 * be added without another migration.

 * Re-attribute tax after a coupon has come off the fare.

 * customer is only ever charged `payableFare`. The booking then claims to have
 * charged more GST than the customer handed over, and it is that claimed
 * figure the invoice prints and the GST report totals — so the operation
 * remits tax on money it never received.
 *
 * GST is due on the transaction value actually charged. A discount recorded on
 * the face of the invoice at the time of supply reduces that value, so the tax
 * is re-derived from `payableFare` treated as tax-inclusive.
 *
 * The customer-facing total is deliberately NOT touched. `payableFare` in and
 * `taxableAmount + gstAmount` out are the same number, so nobody is charged a
 * rupee more or less than before — only the split between value and tax moves,
 * and it moves onto the money that actually changed hands.
 *
 * `preDiscountTaxableAmount` keeps what the rate card priced before the coupon,
 * so the margin the discount came out of stays auditable.
