 * memory of what it was before or when it changed — a customer or admin
 * could see "PICKED_UP" but never when it was accepted, when the rider
 * showed up, or who cancelled it. This mirrors `models/cityParcelEvent.js`,
 * the equivalent already built for the local-delivery flow, so both porter
 * products answer "what happened to this booking, and when" the same way.
 *
 * Written as a side effect of every status change (see
 * services/parcelEventService.js), never updated or deleted afterward.
