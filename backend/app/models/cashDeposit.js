/**
 * A rider handing collected COD cash back to the platform.
 *
 * Before this existed, COD cash had nowhere to go. A porter rider collected
 * cash at pickup, the booking moved to RIDER_HOLDING, and then nothing —
 * `REMITTED_TO_ADMIN` was only ever written by a seller-side Razorpay flow
 * that outstation parcels (which carry no seller) could never reach. The cash
 * sat on the rider's ledger permanently.
 *
 * This is the missing half: the rider declares what they paid back, how, and
 * attaches proof; an admin checks the proof and approves. Only on approval do
 * the covered bookings move to REMITTED_TO_ADMIN. Nothing clears itself.
 *
 * `items` is resolved when the request is raised, oldest booking first, so an
 * approval maps to specific bookings rather than a floating balance — the
 * admin can always answer "which jobs did this ₹X cover".
