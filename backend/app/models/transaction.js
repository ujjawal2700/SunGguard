/**
 * @deprecated Phase 4 (P4-7). Use the canonical `LedgerEntry` collection
 * instead. The `Transaction` collection remains as a legacy parallel
 * ledger that is dual-written by some flows (return refund, COD
 * settlement, withdrawals) for frontend backwards compatibility.
 *
 * Migration plan (post-Phase 4):
 *   1. Phase 4 P4-5 backfills `LedgerEntry` from historical `Transaction`
 *      rows (deterministic `transactionId: "LEGACY-TX-<txId>"`).
 *   2. Phase 6 migrates the read sites (`walletAdminService.*`) to
 *      `LedgerEntry`.
 *   3. Phase 7 stops writing to `Transaction` entirely and removes the
 *      collection (after a 30-day burn-in).
 *
 * NEW finance flows should use `ledgerService.createLedgerEntry` or
 * pass `ledgerType` to `walletService.creditWallet` / `debitWallet`,
 * NOT write to this collection directly.
