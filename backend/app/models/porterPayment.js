/**
 * Every rupee that moves through a payment gateway on the porter desk.
 *
 * Before this collection existed, a porter booking recorded a payment by
 * writing two loose strings onto itself — `razorpayOrderId` and
 * `razorpayPaymentId` — and flipping a four-value `paymentStatus`. That is
 * not a payment record. It cannot answer what the customer actually paid
 * with, whether the money was authorised or captured, what the gateway
 * charged in fees, when each state change happened or what told us about it,
 * whether a refund went out, or what the fare looked like at the moment of
 * sale. It also had no webhook: a customer whose browser died between paying
 * and returning had simply not paid, as far as the database was concerned.
 *
 * One row per ATTEMPT, not per booking. A customer who dismisses the checkout
 * sheet and pays on the second try leaves two rows, and both are true — the
 * first genuinely was abandoned. `attemptCount` orders them.
 *
 * The snapshot fields (`fareSnapshot`, `taxSnapshot`, `bookingSnapshot`) are
 * copies, not references, and that is the point: an invoice printed a year
 * from now has to show the rate card that was actually charged, not whatever
 * the admin has since edited it to.
