/**
 * A rider returning collected COD cash to the platform, online.
 *
 * What this replaces: the admin published a UPI ID, a QR image and a bank
 * account; the rider transferred to it out of band and uploaded a screenshot;
 * an admin looked at the screenshot and clicked approve. Three problems with
 * that, in order of seriousness:
 *
 *   1. A screenshot is not a payment. It proves a rider had an image on their
 *      phone. Nothing in the system had any independent knowledge that money
 *      had moved, so "approval" was an admin's guess.
 *   2. Every deposit was a manual reconciliation against a bank statement,
 *      because the transfer landed with no reference tying it to a rider or
 *      to specific bookings.
 *   3. The destination had to be configured, kept current, and shown to
 *      riders — a whole surface of admin UI existing only because the money
 *      was leaving the system.
 *
 * Now the rider taps Deposit, the gateway opens for the FULL amount they are
 * holding, and the platform receives the money directly into its own account.
 * The admin still approves — that step is what moves the covered bookings to
 * REMITTED_TO_ADMIN — but they are now approving against a captured gateway
 * payment rather than a picture.
 *
 * Partial deposits are refused on purpose. The rule is that a rider deposits
 * what they hold; letting them pay ₹200 of ₹4,800 leaves the cash limit
 * permanently near its ceiling and turns the block into a nuisance rather
 * than a control.
