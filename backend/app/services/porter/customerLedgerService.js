/**
 * Where a porter payment lands once it is real.
 *
 * Three places, each answering a different question:
 *
 *   PorterPayment       — "what did the gateway do?" Full lifecycle, kept by
 *                         services/porter/porterPaymentService.js.
 *   Transaction         — "what does the platform's ledger say?" The legacy
 *                         but still-read ledger the admin finance screens
 *                         aggregate over. Porter never wrote to it, which is
 *                         why porter revenue was invisible beside marketplace
 *                         revenue.
 *   User.transactions   — "what has THIS customer paid?" A capped,
 *                         denormalised strip on the customer document so a
 *                         support agent or the customer's own app can see the
 *                         money trail without a second query.
 *
 * All three are written from here so they cannot drift apart one caller at a
 * time.
