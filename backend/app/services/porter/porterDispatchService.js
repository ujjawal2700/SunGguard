/**
 * Releasing a paid porter booking to riders.
 *
 * Extracted here because THREE different paths now need it — the customer's
 * own verify call, the gateway webhook, and the reconciliation sweep — and
 * before this each of them either had its own copy or simply did not exist.
 * The webhook path not existing is what made an abandoned browser lose a
 * paid booking: the money was taken, and nobody was ever sent to collect the
 * parcel.
 *
 * Every step here is safe to run twice. The broadcast starters are themselves
 * conditional on the booking still being unassigned, and the notifications
 * are advisory. That matters because a webhook and a client verify routinely
 * both land for the same payment, milliseconds apart, and neither can know
 * which of them got there first.
