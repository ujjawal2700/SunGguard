/**
 * The gateway lifecycle for every porter payment.
 *
 * What this replaces: two loose strings on the booking document
 * (`razorpayOrderId`, `razorpayPaymentId`), a four-value `paymentStatus`
 * flipped straight to PAID on a signature check, and no webhook at all. That
 * arrangement had four concrete failures in production terms:
 *
 *   1. A valid signature proves the RECEIPT is genuine. It does not prove the
 *      money was captured. Authorised-but-uncaptured payments were being
 *      treated as paid, and a rider was dispatched against them.
 *   2. A customer whose browser or app died between paying and returning had,
 *      as far as the database was concerned, not paid. The money sat in the
 *      Razorpay account with no booking attached to it.
 *   3. A failure, a refund, a chargeback or a late capture had nowhere to be
 *      recorded, so support had to read the Razorpay dashboard to answer any
 *      question about any payment.
 *   4. Nothing was idempotent. A retried verify or a redelivered event would
 *      re-run every side effect, including starting a second rider broadcast.
 *
 * The shape here mirrors `services/paymentService.js`, which does the same
 * job for marketplace orders, on purpose: one mental model, one provider
 * adapter, one webhook route. It is a separate service rather than an
 * extension of that one because a porter booking has no Order, no seller and
 * no stock to release, and forcing it through a settlement path built around
 * all three is how both break.
