/**
 * How much COD cash a rider is allowed to be carrying, and what happens when
 * they hit it.
 *
 * The rule the business wants is simple and was entirely unimplemented: a
 * rider may hold up to a limit; once they reach it they stop being offered
 * work — local and outstation alike — until they deposit the cash and an
 * admin approves the deposit.
 *
 * What was there before: the admin cash screen aggregated
 * `{ $ifNull: ["$limit", 5000] }` over the Delivery collection. `limit` is
 * not a field on that model and never has been, so every rider read as
 * having exactly a ₹5,000 limit, nothing could change it, and nothing
 * enforced it. The number on screen was decoration.
 *
 * Two levels, resolved here and nowhere else:
 *   global     — Setting.porterCash.globalCashLimit, the fleet default.
 *   per-rider  — Delivery.cashLimit, an override for a specific rider.
 *                Null means "use the global one", which is different from
 *                zero (zero means this rider may carry no cash at all, which
 *                is a legitimate thing to want for a new joiner).
