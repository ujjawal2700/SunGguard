/**
 * Legal status moves for an outstation (pickup-service) parcel.
 *
 * The rider endpoint used to validate only the status being asked for,
 * against a flat allow-list of every non-terminal name. Whether the parcel
 * could actually get there from where it was standing went unchecked, so a
 * rider one tap away from OUT_FOR_DELIVERY could set it directly from
 * ACCEPTED — skipping PICKUP_REACHED and PICKED_UP, and with them the pickup
 * OTP and the proof photo that are the only evidence the parcel ever changed
 * hands. The same gap let a status move backwards, which wrote a timeline
 * that told a story the parcel had not lived.
 *
 * This is the ordered version of that check. It mirrors
 * services/cityParcelStateMachine.js in shape and vocabulary, but the two
 * are deliberately separate: this flow ends when the parcel reaches a
 * courier hub, so it has no receiver handover, no failed attempt and no
 * return leg to express.
