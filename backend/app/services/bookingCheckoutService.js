/**
 * Bookings that exist only to hold a payment gateway order open.
 *
 * Both porter products write their row to the database BEFORE the customer
 * has paid, because Razorpay needs something to hang an order id off and the
 * signature that comes back has to be matched against a booking we already
 * know about. That row is scaffolding, not a booking: nobody has been
 * dispatched, no money has moved, and the customer may simply close the
 * sheet and walk away.
 *
 * Until this module existed, that scaffolding was indistinguishable from a
 * real booking everywhere it was counted — the customer's own waybill
 * history listed deliveries they had never paid for, the admin console
 * showed them as live REQUESTED jobs, and the porter-customer desk counted
 * them into "total bookings" and lifetime spend. Somebody who opened the pay
 * screen twice and left had two phantom bookings to explain.
 *
 * Two halves, deliberately in one file so they cannot drift apart:
 *
 *   - the match that says "this is an open checkout, not a booking", used
 *     to filter every customer- and admin-facing listing;
 *   - the sweep that removes those rows once the sheet can no longer be
 *     paid, so they do not accumulate forever.

/**
 * How long an unpaid booking stays alive before the sweep removes it.
 *
 * Comfortably longer than a Razorpay sheet stays useful (a UPI collect
 * request expires well inside this) but short enough that a customer who
 * comes back the next day is quoted fresh rather than resuming a stale
 * route and price. Also longer than the resumable-booking window, so
 * tapping Pay again always finds its own row to reuse rather than being
 * given a new one because the sweep beat them to it.
