/**
 * RazorpayAdapter
 *
 * Single home for the Razorpay SDK on the order-payment path. `paymentService`
 * only ever sees this through `PaymentProviderPort`, so nothing in the domain
 * imports a vendor SDK.
 *
 * Razorpay is an order + checkout gateway, not a redirect one: the server
 * opens an order, the client launches checkout against it, and the client
 * hands back a receipt signed with the key secret. That receipt is checked
 * here (`verifyCheckoutSignature`) and, independently, a server-to-server
 * webhook confirms the same payment — so a customer who closes the browser
 * mid-payment still gets their order confirmed.
 *
 * The two signatures are different and must not be confused:
 *   checkout receipt → HMAC_SHA256(`${order_id}|${payment_id}`, key_secret)
 *   webhook          → HMAC_SHA256(raw request body, webhook_secret)
