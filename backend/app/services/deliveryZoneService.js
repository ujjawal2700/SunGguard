 * — so the active zones are held in process and the point-in-polygon test runs
 * in memory. A delivery operation has tens of zones with a few dozen corners
 * each; loading them once a minute is far cheaper than a `$geoIntersects`
 * round trip per poll, per rider.
 *
 * This is deliberately the ONLY implementation of "is this point in a zone".
 * The admin's coordinate tester goes through here too, so what an admin
 * verifies on screen is exactly what the booking gate enforces.
 *
 * Outstation parcels (`models/parcel.js`) never consult this — that flow is
 * unzoned by design.
