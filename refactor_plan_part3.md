## 5.2 Architecture Stabilization First Rule

Before adding **any** new features after reading this plan, complete these 4 items from Phase 1:
1. **P1.1** — Eliminate duplicated return window functions (prevents financial calculation drift)
2. **P1.3** — Standardize logging (critical for production observability)
3. **P1.5** — Shared validate() middleware (prevents new controllers from adding more inline validation)
4. **P4.1** — Fix frontend auth role detection (prevents brittle auth breakage on route changes)

These 4 items together take less than 2 days and have near-zero risk. They prevent the existing technical debt from compounding with every new feature.

# 6. SAFE DECOUPLING STRATEGY

## 6.1 The Wrapper Pattern (Default for All Extractions)

When extracting a function from a large file into a new service, always follow this 3-step pattern:

**Step 1 — Create the new service (no changes to existing file)**
```js
// app/services/order/orderReturnService.js (NEW)
export async function createReturnRequest(customerId, orderId, payload) {
  // paste logic here
}
```

**Step 2 — Replace inline logic with a call to the new service**
```js
// app/controller/orderController.js (UPDATED)
import { createReturnRequest } from '../services/order/orderReturnService.js';

export const requestReturn = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const result = await createReturnRequest(req.user.id, req.params.orderId, req.body);
    return handleResponse(res, 200, "Return request submitted", result);
  } catch (error) {
    return handleResponse(res, error.statusCode || 500, error.message);
  }
};
```

**Step 3 — Verify with tests, then delete the old inline logic**

The old function stays in place until Step 3. Zero breakage risk during Step 1 and 2.

---

## 6.2 The Re-Export Pattern (For Folder Reorganization)

When moving a file to a new location, never break existing imports:

```js
// Old location: app/services/cacheService.js (KEEP THIS FILE)
// New location: app/infrastructure/cache/cacheService.js

// Old file becomes a re-export shim:
export * from '../infrastructure/cache/cacheService.js';
```

All old imports continue working. New code imports from the new path. Remove the shim only after 100% of old imports are migrated.

---

## 6.3 The Feature Flag Pattern (For Provider Swaps)

For high-risk changes like the payment provider abstraction:

```js
// app/services/payment/providerRegistry.js
import { PhonePeAdapter } from './providers/phonepe.adapter.js';

export function getActivePaymentProvider() {
  const providerName = process.env.PAYMENT_PROVIDER || 'phonepe';
  if (providerName === 'phonepe') return new PhonePeAdapter();
  // future: if (providerName === 'razorpay') return new RazorpayAdapter();
  throw new Error(`Unknown payment provider: ${providerName}`);
}
```

Rollback = set `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=phonepe` in env. No code change needed.

---

## 6.4 How to Isolate Providers Safely

**Payment Provider:**
- All SDK imports live inside `providers/phonepe.adapter.js` only.
- `paymentService.js` never imports the SDK.
- Tests mock `PaymentProviderPort`, never the SDK.

**Firebase Provider:**
- Already wrapped in `firebaseService.js` — good. Move to `infrastructure/firebase/`.
- Notification module calls `firebaseService.send()`, never `firebase-admin` directly.

**SMS Provider:**
- `smsIndiaHubService.js` is already a wrapper — move to `infrastructure/sms/`.
- If switching SMS provider, only the adapter file changes.

**Maps Provider:**
- `mapsGeocodeService.js` and `mapsRouteService.js` wrap Google Maps SDK — already correct pattern.
- Move both to `infrastructure/maps/` in Phase 5.

**Cloudinary Media:**
- `mediaService.js` wraps Cloudinary — already correct pattern.
- Move to `infrastructure/media/` in Phase 5.

## 6.5 How to Migrate Old Logic Gradually

**For `orderController.js` (2004 lines):**

Do NOT extract everything at once. Use the "strangler fig" pattern:
1. Extract `OrderReturnService` (return-related handlers) → ~300 lines removed
2. Extract query handlers to `OrderQueryService` → ~200 lines removed
3. Extract `OrderCancellationService` → ~150 lines removed
4. Remaining controller handles placement + workflow delegation

After all extractions, `orderController.js` should be < 400 lines — pure HTTP adapters.

**Timeline:** One extraction per sprint (1–2 weeks each). Never extract two unrelated handlers in the same PR to keep rollback scope narrow.

---

## 6.6 Frontend Progressive Migration

**For monolithic page files (80KB+):**

1. **Do NOT create a new page and delete the old one.** Decompose in place.
2. Extract the most reusable component first (usually the table or form).
3. Import it back into the page file immediately — the page still works.
4. Repeat for the next component.
5. When the page file is < 200 lines, the extraction is complete.

**Example sequence for `ProductManagement.jsx`:**
- Week 1: Extract `ProductListTable.jsx` → import back
- Week 2: Extract `ProductFormModal.jsx` → import back
- Week 3: Extract `ProductFilters.jsx` → import back
- Week 4: Page shell is now ~150 lines. Extraction complete.

## 7.3 Shared Systems — Target Contracts

### Backend Domain Contracts

Every domain service exposes a clean contract:

```js
// Domain service pattern
class OrderReturnService {
  static async createReturnRequest(customerId, orderId, payload) { ... }
  static async getReturnDetails(orderId, userId, role) { ... }
  static async approveReturn(orderId, actorId) { ... }
  static async rejectReturn(orderId, actorId, reason) { ... }
}
```

Every controller is a pure HTTP adapter:
```js
export const requestReturn = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const result = await OrderReturnService.createReturnRequest(...);
    return handleResponse(res, 200, "...", result);
  } catch (e) {
    return handleResponse(res, e.statusCode || 500, e.message);
  }
};
```

### Frontend API Layer Contract

Every API module follows the same shape:
```js
// modules/admin/services/orders.api.js
export const getAdminOrders = (params) => axiosInstance.get('/admin/orders', { params });
export const updateOrderStatus = (orderId, status) => axiosInstance.patch(`/admin/orders/${orderId}/status`, { status });
```

Every page uses hooks, never raw axios:
```js
// In the page component:
const { data, loading, error, refetch } = useApiState(
  () => getAdminOrders(filters),
  [filters]
);
```

---

## 7.4 Key Architecture Principles for Final State

| Principle | Backend Implementation | Frontend Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Low Coupling** | Controllers import only domain services. Domain services import only ports/interfaces. Infra is isolated in `infrastructure/`. | Pages import only hooks. Hooks import only API services. API services import only axiosInstance. |
| **High Cohesion** | Each domain folder owns its controller, service, validation, and routes. | Each module folder owns its pages, components, services, and hooks. |
| **Provider Replacement** | Payment, SMS, Maps, Firebase all behind adapter classes. Swap by changing `providerRegistry` only. | Auth token storage behind `activeRoleStore`. API base URL behind `resolveApiBaseUrl`. |
| **Testability** | Services can be unit-tested by mocking ports. Controllers tested via supertest. | Hooks tested with `renderHook`. Components tested with mocked API responses. |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Re-export shims at old paths during migration. Old API endpoints never removed. | Old component imports kept via index.js re-exports during migration. |

---

## 7.5 What This Architecture Supports

| Capability | Supported After Refactor |
|---|---|
| Add a new payment provider | Create new adapter in `providers/`, register in `providerRegistry.js` |
| Add a new delivery provider | Create adapter in `infrastructure/delivery/`, implement port |
| Add a new portal (e.g. warehouse manager) | Add `modules/warehouse/` on frontend, new domain in backend |
| Scale order processing horizontally | Worker role already separated — add more worker instances |
| Replace SMS provider | Swap `infrastructure/sms/smsService.js` implementation only |
| Add new notification channel | Add handler in `notification.builder.js` — no other files change |
| Add new scheduled job | Add to `app/jobs/`, register in `startScheduler()` in `index.js` |
| Onboard a new developer | Domain folder structure is self-documenting. Each domain is a closed unit. |
| Write unit tests for order logic | `OrderReturnService` has no HTTP dependencies — pure testable JS |
| Feature-flag a new workflow | `process.env.FEATURE_*` guard in the service layer |

## 7.6 Summary: Metrics Before vs After

| Metric | Current | Target After All Phases |
|---|---|---|
| Largest controller file | 2,004 lines | < 400 lines |
| Largest frontend page file | 80,952 bytes | < 20 KB |

## 7.7 Final Principles Reminder

**This refactor is done when:**

1. ✅ No controller imports Redis, Bull, or any provider SDK directly
2. ✅ No business rule exists in two places
3. ✅ Every payment provider is behind an adapter
4. ✅ Every controller is < 400 lines and only delegates to services
5. ✅ Every frontend page is < 300 lines and only composes components
6. ✅ Every repeated UI pattern has a shared component
7. ✅ All server-state fetching goes through typed hooks, not raw useEffect
8. ✅ New developers can find any feature by looking in the domain folder

**This refactor is NOT done when it becomes:**
- Microservices (it shouldn't — stay monolith)
- Over-abstracted (don't add ports where there is only one possible implementation)
- A rewrite (every step preserves existing behavior)
